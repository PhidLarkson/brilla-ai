    "##### Title: A script For Cropping Videos Based on Timestamps\n",
    "###### By: Ernest Samuel, Team member; Data preprocessing Team\n",
    "###### Date: 05-08-2023\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is a script for cropping videos based on timestamps. It takes two input files: an Excel file containing the timestamps and a directory containing the videos to be cropped. The script first reads the Excel file and creates a Pandas DataFrame containing the timestamps. Then, it iterates through the DataFrame and crops the corresponding videos. The cropped videos are saved in the same directory as the original videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The key points of use of this code are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can be used to crop videos based on any set of timestamps.\n",
    "- It is easy to use and can be run from the command line.\n",
    "- It is efficient and can crop videos quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is written in Python and uses the moviepy library. The moviepy library is a powerful library for working with videos in Python. It allows you to read, write, edit, and process videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code, you will need to install the *moviepy library*. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "                pip install moviepy\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have installed the moviepy library, you can run the code by saving it as a Python file and then running it from the command line. For example, if you saved the code as crop_video.py, you could run it by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "                python crop_video.py\n",
    "                \n",
    "This will crop the videos and save them in the same directory as the original videos."
